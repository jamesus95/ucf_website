						<span class="bold">BELONG</span> - We place high value on our friendships with each other and work hard to provide opportunities for them to both start and grow.  We welcome antone to come and be a part of UCF.<br><br>We believe that Jesus invited all people to come and be a part of what he was doing and it is our goal to do the same.  We believe that God lives in a diverse yet unified community (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) three separate persons, yet one God.  In mirroring that image we value deep, integrated, hoistic connection with God and with one another in a way that brings healing, a sense of belinging, and joy.
					</div>
					<div>
						<span class="bold">PARTICIPATE</span> - Whether you're just beginning to wonder about spirituality and who Jesus really is or have been following God for years, UCF is a place where you can ask questions, be challenged and grow by being a part of everything we are doing.<br><br>We believe that God had called us to be part of his work in this world.  Whether that be playing a game of Ultimate, volunteering with a service project, grabbing coffee together, playing music for worship, becoming a conversation partner for an international student or one of the many other ways that we participate in God's work of recon ciling all of creation to himself.
					</div>
					<div>
						<span class="bold">TRANSFORM</span> - As each of us steps out to know Jesus better or to help those around us, we both take part in transforming our world for the better, and experience God transforming each of us.  God doesn't call us to just understand him in theorym bu to experience him in and through our lives.  THat involves the risk of getting to know the people around us, using our talents and abilities to make a difference in our world and allowing God to work directly in our lives.<br><br>As we participate in what God is doing on campus, in our city, and in the global community we believe that God will bring transformation both to out own lives and the lives of the people we meet.  It is our desire for God to continute to change us so that we would be more like him, sharing in his heart for the world, his ministry of reconciling all things to himself, and his desire that all would be able to know him.

						<span class="bold">Where We're Going</span> - We weren't meant to be stagnant ... to stay in one place.  Life is fluid and growth and laughter should be a part of it.  Five things mark the direction UCF is moving in. We are striving to become...<br><br><div class="col-md-6"><span class="bold">a community of friendship</span><br>As was mentioned before, friendship is a very important part of where we want to be.  UCF is a place where people can know and be know by each other as we truly live life together.<br><br></div><div class="col-md-6"><span class="bold">a community of discipleship</span><br>By a community of discipleship we mean a place where students are actively growing in their understanding of and maturity in Jesus.  Jesus calls all of us to be his disciples and to disciple others (to help them along in their walk with God).  Core groups (small group Bible study and discipleship groups) that meet weekly are designed to be places where people can get to know one another, pursue God, ask questions, and challenge on another.</div><div class="col-md-12"><span class="bold">a community of witness</span><br>Jesus came to show the world what God was like and to make a way for us to reconnect with him.  UCF in the same way seeks to be a place that reflects Jesus to the students at UW and the people of Seattle.  This happens in a number of ways.  It happens as we reach out to our classmates and neighbors in friendship, honesty, and service.  It happens when we help one of the many internation students at UW deal with the differences of a new country.  It happens at the info table.  And it happens through our short term missions trips as students journey to places near and far to offer help and tell others about Jesus.</div><br><div class="col-md-6"><span class="bold">a community of worship</span><br>Worship simply means to attribute worth ro an object or person.  In UCF we seek to allow our entire lives to reflect our realization and adoration of who God is.  A couple of the ways we live this out are by singing at our Friday Night gatherings, or at our worship music jam nights, but it is also something we seek to enact through all of our actions and interations.</div><div class="col-md-6"><span class="bold">a community of prayer</span><br>Prayer does a number of things.  It draws us closer to God, it expresses love and worth to those we pray for and it impacts the world around us.<br><br>Prayer is integrated into everything we do in UCF; whether at our specific weekly prayer meeting, gathering together on Firday night, hanging out in Cores, sponsoring a campus event or just sitting down with a friend!<br></div>UCF is many things.  Our hope is to be a place of discovery and community, a place where sutdents are free to risk because of the hope we find in God, and the support of the friendships that are being forged.  We hope you'll want to join in and be a part of what God is doing here!
